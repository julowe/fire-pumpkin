# Fire Breathing Pumpkin!
Wherein we hook up a motion sensor to a Glade Automated Air Freshener, stick it in a pumpkin, put a tealight in front of it, and make sure not to burn anyone.

## Code & Guide
The code was originally copied from [Richard Osgood's version from the WayBack Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20131106091413/http://www.richardosgood.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/fireLantern_v1.ino), but I actually ended up not using any as I had a motion sensor, not a distance sensor. Code checked in to maintain a copy of it and to acknowledge the inspiration. A [great Youtube video is available](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDRTbuhs05Q) showing his build process.

I had just enough pieces to hack something together the day of Halloween. And even found a pumpkin spice glade scented can! (For pumpkin scented flaming breath) I also added a button to manually trigger the flame breath, because.

I will try to document what I did to get it to work, but looking at my wiring and code a few days later I have no idea how it actually managed to work...

## Future Upgrades
The Glade Air Freshener worked pretty well, but I wanted more fire, for longer. So I hope to add some STL files so we can 3d print a holder for a travel size hairspray can and a tealight, actuated with a servo. Maybe also some relatively water-resistant housings for the motion sensor and arduino with spikes to stab/mount into the pumpkin.

I will hopefully be able to clean up my mess of a first version so you can still do this with easy enough to find and assemble parts (just with the Glade Air Freshener, motion sensor, arduino, and no 3d printer).
